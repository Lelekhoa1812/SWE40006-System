# Observability Strategy

## Current Implementation

### Backend Logging

- **Pino** structured logging with request/response hooks
- Request logging: method, URL, user agent, IP
- Response logging: status code, response time
- Business logic logging: doctor fetch operations with counts

### Frontend Metrics

- **Web Vitals** placeholder in `lib/metrics.ts`
- Console logging for development
- Ready for Application Insights integration

## Future Implementation

### Application Insights

- Server-side telemetry for backend
- Browser telemetry for frontend
- Custom events and metrics
- Performance monitoring

### Dashboards

- Request/response metrics
- Error rates and response times
- User journey tracking
- System health indicators

### Alerts

- High error rates
- Slow response times
- System downtime
- Resource utilization

### Load Testing

- `scripts/load-test.sh` for local testing
- Artillery/autocannon integration
- Performance baseline establishment

## Monitoring Endpoints

- `/health` - system health check
- `/api/v1/doctors` - business logic monitoring
